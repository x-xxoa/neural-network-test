# neural-network-test
this is my collection of neural network tests, remember these are tests and while they work they would fall apart easily.
most of the stuff here is probably when i was thinking and randomly had a burst of motivation to do something.
also these do not use external packages because i want this to be portable and easy to run, just pure lua 5.4.
