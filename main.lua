DOCUMENTATION:

the "tableToInput" value is the table for the input.

the "mode" value is either for a circle or a square, 1 for circle, 0 for square.

the "gridx" and "gridy" values are the size of the grid, the dimensions of the input neurons. (YES I GET IT IT SOUNDS
LIKE GRITTY)

unfortunately for right now you have to adjust the input table, weights and current values table or else it won't work
and right now im not fixing it because during my lunch time at school im working on this so maybe ill update it later.

the "debug" value shows the debug information like the bias and the table values, if its 0 it will just print "1" or "0"
which cooresponds to the circle or the square.
