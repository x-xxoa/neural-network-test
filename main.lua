DOCUMENTATION:

the "tableToInput" value is the table for the input.

the "mode" value is either for a circle or a square, 1 for circle, 0 for square.

the "gridx" and "gridy" values are the size of the grid, the dimensions of the input neurons. (YES I GET IT IT SOUNDS
LIKE GRITTY)

i'm working on making the inputweights and currentvalues better so i'll commit it in the next build because right now i 
dont trust myself.

the "debug" value shows the debug information like the bias and the table values, if its 0 it will just print "1" or "0" 
which cooresponds to the circle or the square. (must be a 1 or a 0)

if the "tryagain" value is 1 then it will try again without exiting the function and if it is 0 then it will return and
exit the function (not recommended in normal use but for training might be good)
